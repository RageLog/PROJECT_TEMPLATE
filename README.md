# PROJECT_TEMPLATE
Project template for ease start up
#Project template for cmake.
->this is provide to you that, cmake-git-software parallel versioning, guiding to project,fast development.

main file zip because, main file is contain extra .git file and github cannot open that.

-> I tested this with clang for msvc and ninja
-> if you want to create package,go to build file with cd build and than type ninja package
